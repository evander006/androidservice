# Android Music App ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to my Android Music App repository! This project is a hands-on exploration of Android services, including **Foreground** and **Bound Services**, as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of Android development.

## Key Features
- **Music Playback**: A simple music player that supports playing 5 preloaded songs.
- **Notification Integration**: The app displays a persistent notification when music is playing, allowing users to control playback (play, pause, stop) directly from the notification panel.
- **Service Implementation**:
  - **Foreground Service**: Ensures music continues playing even when the app is in the background.
  - **Bound Service**: Manages communication between the UI and the music playback logic.

## What I Learned
- How to create and manage different types of services in Android.
- Implementing media playback using `MediaPlayer`.
- Using `NotificationManager` to create interactive notifications.
- Handling lifecycle events for services and ensuring smooth user experience.
